# Simon - The game

  This game is inspired from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)

  You essentially have four colored tiles that can be clicked on. Press any key to begin the game.

  A round in the game consists of the tiles lighting up one after the other in a random order, after which the player must reproduce the sequence, by clicking on the tiles in the same order, to proceed to the next level.

  The game ends when the player messes up the sequence.

  See how far you can go! Enjoy!
